# BrewMate Project Database

First time setup: 
1. run the create database script
2. download the files and run the load_data script
3. if needed, run the provision_user script

Testing:
Example calls to implemented stored procedures are in TEST_SPs
To test a route i've been calling curl http://localhost:5000/api/topbeers after starting the server via "node server.js"
